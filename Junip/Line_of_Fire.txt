What would you do
if it all came back to you?
Each crest of each wave
bright as lightning
What would you say
if you had to leave today?
leave everything behind
even though for once, you're shining

Standing on higher ground
when you hear the sounds
you realize it's just a whim
And you notice it matters
who and what you let under your skin

If Put to the test
would you step back from the line of fire?
Hold everything back
all emotions and desires


Convince yourself
To be someone else
and fight from the world
your lack of confidence.
What you choose to believe in
Dictates your rise or your fall

Dictates your rise or your fall
With no one else around you
no one to understand you
no one to hear your calls.
Look through all your dark corners
When you're backed up against the wall

step back from the line of fire
What would you do
if it all came back to you?
each crest of each wave

bright as lightning
do the same as you do
do the same as you do
do the same as you
do the same as you
I do the same as you
Do the same as you
do the same as you do
What you choose to believe in

Dictates your rise or your fall
With no one else around you
no one to understand you
no one to hear your calls.
Look through all your dark corners
when you're backed up against the wall
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire
Step back
Step back
Step back
