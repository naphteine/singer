====== Move with the Season ======
Created Saturday 28 August 2021

When the time comes, move with the season
Lend your young ears to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the feeling
Lend your young ears to the sound of day

When the time comes, move with the seasons
Lend your young ears to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the feeling
Lend your ears to the sound of day

In our place where [?]
Stretch the sunlight on our minds
Bringing life to the size
Waiting on some skies of light

Take the handle, make it out now, never
Take the crystal quill from me now, all we see
The ink upon the glass
The season through the night now paper white
Making plans upon a crimson moonrise
Take your crystal from the ground, now, all we see
The see-through-colored words
The season through the night now paper white

When the time comes, move with the seasons
Lend your young ears to the sound of day
When the time comes, move with the feeling
Lend your ears to the sound of day

Take the handle, make it out now, never
Take the crystal quill from me now, all we see
The ink upon the glass
The season through the night now paper white
Making plans upon a crimson moonrise
Take your crystal from the ground, now, all we see
The see-through-colored words
The season through the night now paper white

Take the handle, move it forth
Save the memory of the star
Now your life has changed
And though there is no yonder
Had he known that you were fonder
Of the things you had from birth

Take the handle, move it forth
Save the memory of the star
Now your life has changed
And though there is no yonder
Had he known that you were fonder
Of the things you had from birth
