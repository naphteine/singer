Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Just sleep in the sunlight

Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Keep in the dark just stay out of the light
Just staying in the sunshine

La, ah, ah
La, ah, ah
La, ah, ah
La, ah, ah

Turn off your light, let's step into the dark
Sleep away like shining into her
Save your face and get behind, it's firmly pressed into earth
I feel relief when I talk, eventually comes
Talk of our dreams, you surely have one
Mind your head and keep your hands firmly pressed into earth

Earth
Earth
Earth

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling dressed in white
A shameful display, sung in some other place
To keep in the dark

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling dressed in white
I come with a string to recover the world
She sings in the night and never grows on

Night falling, face is red with wondering eyes
Drawn to a beauty left to lay in the light
Climb the stairs and keep only precious white wine full of worth

Dressed in all, safe from the dark
But dressed in a body looked stranger to her
Flashing my attempt to calling an all showing girl
Your true words, words

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling dressed in white
A shameful display, sung in some impermanent place
To keep in the dark

Dream on and sleep won't save you from the night
Drink up darling dressed in white
I come with a string to recover the world
She sings in the night and never grows old
