====== Woke From Dreaming ======
Created Friday 10 September 2021

Woke from dreaming
but it took convincing
i was shaking screaming
i was still alive
And you were picking strangers by the side of roadways
little little let the danger unfold
You can do what you do
if you think you'll take it
you can do what you do
if you are that way inclined
Suffer with silk
as the pressure's tighter
you have skin pale as milk
with the pressure on
My heart is getting heavy and my hands are weak now
hatred lifting and i'll start to weep now
You can do what you do
if you think you'll take it
you can do what you do
if you are that way inclined
Just for a moment
can we take a little time
just stop for a moment
can we make this moment mine
I've tried to let go but i've never had much to say
take a day take them all now
Just for a moment
can we take a little time
just stop for a moment
can we look inside this mind
We try to control but we never quite know what's there
we will kill if we need to...

just for a moment
can we take a little time
just stop for a moment
can we make this moment mine
I've tried to let go but i've never had much to say...
