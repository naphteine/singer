====== These Old Shoes ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

Well, they said, ?it was the cheapest fare at this time of year?
And they said, ?It's nice and safe, you got nothing to fear?
So I will take this old plane to get to you
Yes, I will take this old plane to get to you

Twenty minutes late the plane crashes down
And I'm one of three left amongst a priest and a clown
And then all I can hear is the hiss of the track
I said, ?why the hell not? and I jump on the back
And I will take this old train to get to you
Yes, I will take this old train to get to you

She said, ?get off my train you dirty hobo?
And I tried to explain but it was a no go
It was a no go for this hobo

He said for fifty bucks I could take it
He was sure that this lemon could make it
So I will take this old car to get to you
Yes, I will take this old car to get to you

(He said you could take it)

Couple miles out of this old part of town
My engine explodes with a horrible sound
But I will take these old shoes to get to you
Yes, I will take these old shoes to get to you
Oh, I will take these old shoes to get to you
Yes, I will take these old shoes to get to you
