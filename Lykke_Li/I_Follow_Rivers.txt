====== I Follow Rivers ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

Oh I beg you, can I follow
Oh I ask you why not always
Be the ocean where unravel
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading
You're my river running high, run deep run wild

I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark room honey
I follow you

He a message, I'm the runner
He's the rebel, I'm the daughter waiting for you
You're my river running high, run deep run wild

I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark room honey

I follow you

You're my river running high, run deep run wild
I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby,
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark room honey,
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby,
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark room honey,
I follow you

I, I follow, I follow you deeps sea baby,
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark room honey,
I follow you

I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you dark room honey,
I follow you

I, I follow, I follow you deep sea baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you dark room honey
I follow you
