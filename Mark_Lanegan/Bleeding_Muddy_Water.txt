Created Friday 26 March 2021

Lord, now the rain done come
Lord, now the rain done come
Muddy water rising up
You know I feel you in my iron lung
Muddy water, celestial flood
You know I feel you in my iron lung
I feel you, feel you in my iron lung
Muddy water, Lord, now the rain done come

Oh baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Muddy water drowning in the rain
Now the rain done come

Lord, now the rain done come
Lord, now the rain done come
Muddy water pillar to post
How do I bleed you? Just like a ghost
Muddy water, heaven’s son
You are the bullet yeah, you are the gun
You're the bullet, bullet, bullet and the gun
Muddy water, you're heaven’s son

Oh baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad

Muddy water drowning in the rain
Now the rain done come
Muddy water drowning in the rain
Now the rain done come

Lord, now the rain done come
Lord, now the rain done come

Muddy water, be my grave
You are the master, I’ve been the slave
Muddy water, come rising up
You know I feel you, in my iron lung

I feel you, feel you in my iron lung
Muddy water, come rising up

Oh baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad

Muddy water drowning in the rain

Muddy water drowning in the rain
Now the rain done come

Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
Oh baby baby, don’t it feel so bad
