====== Born into the Sunset ======
Created Thursday 02 September 2021

I was born
I was thrown into the sunset
You were there
And a outside a sleepy window array
I was tossed
In towards of happy Sundays
By the fair
Memories fade into the weekend away

Every night
I will work until the sun's up
In disguise
Of a silent, sleepy window array
Carousel
Spin me 'round until I'm seasick
I was born
I was born into the sunset today
Sunset today

Be as it may
Don't let anyone tell you
On and on, it's true
You sit on your chances and see
That the world doesn't end at your feet
Be as it may
Only knowing is needing
On a open sea
You lay on the surface and breathe
And you feel the eruption, I'm free
Paradise
Married us into the sunset
Mellow cries
Amplified until the sound's red alert
I was drawn
In the webs of the surroundings
I was born
I was born into the sunset today
Sunset today

Born of the night
Born of the night
Measuring miles
Everyone smiles

Be as it may
Don't let anyone tell you
On and on, it's true
You sit on your chances and see
That the world doesn't end at your feet
Be as it may
Only knowing is needing
On a open sea
You lay on the surface and breathe
And you feel the eruption, I'm free
