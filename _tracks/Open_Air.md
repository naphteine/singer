====== Open Air ======
Created Thursday 02 September 2021

One sweet sight
Has the magnitude of a mountain's high
Through the foreboding chime of freedom
We try

Feed your fear
With the famine of a thousand years
Sleep in an empty room of concert
And green

Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air

We first left
From behind and from inside our heads
Choosing the wills to learn
And leave from the past
Conscience calls
Through the telephone from months before
Opaque and dimly lit
We move with the night
Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air

In times we think about it
The vastness of this palace view
In dreams we feel the winding of the months and the year
We chose to be

Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air
The open air we'll see

Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air
The open air we'll see
Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air
The open air we'll see

Say what you will
Don't water down
With the tears
Of your old frown
Move to see
The open air
