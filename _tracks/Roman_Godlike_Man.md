====== Roman Godlike Man ======
Created Thursday 02 September 2021


Owe what to clare for man
And promise to never smile
Living inside the lifelong dream
Never a part through his fantasy

Owe what is come wrong now
This policy all you've got
I which it could be a godlike man inside of your museum

So close per year
So
Fa Fa Fa...

So close per year
So
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum

Look for the master plan
Never wealthy shot
Imagine a day without empire
Use to the after light set on fire

Dozen believe the truth
This cats can't be on time
I wish it could be a godlike man inside of your museum

So close per year
So
Fa Fa Fa...

So close per year
So
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum

So close per year
So
Fa Fa Fa...

So close per year
So
Never a real life statue in your modern coluseum
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum
Never a roman godlike man inside of your museum
