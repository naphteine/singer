[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ooh, ooh
Do what with which you can't explain or what you've never seen
Take your ship, you own the ship, your ship that's coming in
Do what you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't you get it in?
Do what you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you, take it in
Do what you know you've never been, it's really just a shame
What you can and know it, everyone is all the same
If you can't get back again, you can change the way it is
And what you can't and where and all, you think will begins

[Verse 1]
What you can't and can't and if you're never coming back
What you can and loose it, blues it, choose it, do what you like If you loose your way again, you've just been mistaken
And what you can't and can't and put the cards back in the stack

[Verse 2]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ooh, ooh
Ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cut and cut and crack it up
Cr-crack, cr-crack, yes, oh I can cut you, catch you, catch you, catch you gettin' older
You can't get quick, you can't commit, you can't control her
Without, remember bodies sold to Sunday, getting colder

[Bridge]
Oh, so civilized so you cannot take it
Oh, you cannot take it
Oh, you cannot make it
A force has come is stil alive
Oh, open up and take it
All the money, take it
Oh, you cannot take it
Night time, chin-chin and worry 'bout the nation
What you cannot take
Yeah, no one cannot take you
Rise slow, close the blinds and wonder what you take, yeah
Oh, you cannot take you, oh, you cannot take you

[Chorus]
