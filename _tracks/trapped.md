Should I listen to what you say?

Or listen to what your folks say?
It's a tough decision to make.
I don't really want to lose you,
But I don't want your folks to
Turn me over to the hands of the law.
I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you.
I can tell the way they act and they attitude.
As the tears roll from my eyes
I can feel the hurt inside.
As I reach out to you said I'm so confused.
Oh, oh I'm trapped.
Like a fool I'm in a cage,
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Like a fool I'm in a cage,
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out.
If we love one another,
Why should we let this go further?
Can't you see it's gonna' pull us apart?
If you think I can afford you,
Support you if you want to,
Ever think about settlin' down...
I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you.
I can tell the way they act and they attitude.
As the tears roll from my eyes
I feel the hurt inside.
As I reach out to you said I'm so confused.
Oh, oh I'm trapped.
Like a fool I'm in a cage,
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Like a fool I'm in a cage,
I can't get out.
See I'm trapped,
Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out.
Can't you see I'm so trapped and I don't know what to do.
Can't you see I'm so trapped
Droolin' over you.
See I'm trapped
And I'm, so confused
I'm like a man in a cage
And I'm so in love with you
But your folks
I'm trapped
Your folks are in the way
And I don't know what to say
You see I'm trapped
But I don't want your folks to
Turn me over to the hands of the law.
What I'm gonna' do about it.
They think that I'm not good enough for you.
