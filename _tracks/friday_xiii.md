====== Friday XIII ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

Come on baby it's a quarter to five
I've been living on the couch and I'm losing my mind
I haven't gotten a touch in a long, long time
Since Friday XIII part nine, going to hell
Thumbing through all the magazines
And I can drink a lot better than I could in my teens
Have we learned nothing but to kick and scream?
We're as civilized as we could have ever dreamed and what's that mean?
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
The kind of attraction I couldn't leave
Keep watching the static on TV
Might be as well but not as bad
When your silence shows of our public failure
I woke up in the middle of the night
Sheets soaked, still drunk, terrified
Something tells me you're not alive
The pulse keeps getting softer
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Come on, baby
You've got something to lose
I'll buy you new clothes
I'll buy you new shoes
All kinds of things that we could really use
But all I need is you
I need you girl, you got that heart and soul
We've been living in the dark and digging our holes
But all that we need's right under our nose
Boy, don't you think I know?
I guess so
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Please love me again
