I am just like an arrow
Heading straight for a destiny
And no-one and nothing can take that away from me
It's something that defies what the eye can see

And nothing and no-one is as real
And as pure and as dark as a dream

I was just like a sailor
Heading out to uncharted seas
I thought that the limit was the horizon
Discovered there was more than the eye could see

And nothing and no-one is as real
And as pure and as dark as a dream
And nothing, no, nothing lasts forever
And I take heart in all that I cannot see

Cause I was just like an arrow
Heading straight for a destiny
Then I met you and the world opened up in front of me
Revealing there was more than the eye could see...
