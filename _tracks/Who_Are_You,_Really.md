====== Who Are You, Really ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

So you're feeling tied up to a sense of control
And make decisions that you think are your own
You are a stranger here, why have you come?
Why have you come, lift me higher, let me look at the sun
Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say

Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I've got nothing left to prove
Cause I've got nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you
Who, who are you?

Now you're moving on and you say you're alone
Suspicious that this string is moving your bones
We are the fire, we see how they run
See how they run, lift me higher, let me look at the sun
Look at the sun and once I hear them clearly, say

Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I've got nothing left to prove
Cause I've got nothing left to lose
See me bare my teeth for you
See me bare my teeth

Who, who are you really?
And where are you going?
I've got nothing left to prove
Cause I've got nothing left to lose
See me bare mu teeth for you
Who, who are you?
