====== Girls Just Want to Have Fun ======
Created Wednesday 17 February 2021

I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun, oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun, oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want, some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
Girls they wanna have fun, oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want, some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls, just wanna have fun
Girls, they wanna, wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

Just wanna, they just wanna
Just wanna, they just wanna
Just wanna, they just wanna
Just wanna, they just wanna

Just wanna, they just wanna
Just wanna, they just wanna
Just wanna, they just wanna
