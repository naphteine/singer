[Verse]
I know I should go
But I want to stay
Here with you in this room
I can tell we'll never be alone

[Chorus]
Never mind, okay
Never mind, okay
Never mind, okay

[Alan Watts - "The Philosophies of Asia"]
The beginning of philosophy is wonder
Philosophy is man's expression of curiosity about everything
And his attempt to make sense of the world through his intellect

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you have to go
But I want to keep you to myself
Like a dream
I can tell we'll never be alone

[Chorus]
Never mind, okay
Never mind, okay
Never mind, okay

[Alan Watts - "The Philosophies of Asia"]
And "thinking", of course, is a word used in many ways
And is a very vague word for most people
But I use the word "thinking" in a very precise way
By "thinking", as distinct from feeling or emoting or sensing
I mean the manipulation of symbols
Whether they be words, whether they be numbers
Or whether they be other signs
As say a triangle, squares, circles, astrological signs, or whatever
These are symbols
Sometimes a symbol...
