====== Aru Shunjitsu no Uta ======
Created Monday 02 November 2020

"Sekai wa hidoku minikuku aware nari"
Dakara kimi wo mamorou to suru sekai kara kimi wo mamotte agetai
"Sekai wa futari no mirai wo anji suru mono nari"
Dakara sore made no aida, semete kimi dake wa mamotte agetai

Shinjitsu wa tsune ni katawara ni daga hito wa tsune ni moumoku narite
Oroka na zatto ni kakikesareru mono nari

Kimi no soba de semete futari, shinjitsu wo shiranai mama de
Yoru wo koete, yume mite
Yagate futari mezameta nara
Atarashii owari wo tsugeru uta wo kasane awasete

Aru shinjitsu no uragawa ni aru "shinjitsu" wo shiru mono
Aru ataerareta shinjitsu wo "shinjitsu" to sakebu mono

Toki wa megurite, sekai wa kimi wo madowaseru tame ni toikakeru
Nogarerarenu sadame ni aragau mo mirai

Nagai yoru ga akete futari, haru no yoru no yume wo samayou
Nani mo shirazu, kikoezu
Tada futari wa arishi hibi no mirai e tsunagaritai dake
Sore wa dare no shinjitsu?

Kimi no soba de semete futari, shinjitsu wo shiranai mama de
Yoru wo koete, yume mite
Yagate futari mezameta nara
Atarashii sekai wo tsugeru uta wo kasane awasete


"The world is cruel, ugly, and pitiful"
And so, I'll try to protect you, I want to protect you from the world
"The world is secretly leading the two's future"
And so, at least until then, I want to protect you

The truth is always nearby, but people are always blind
Getting erased into foolish crowds

At the least, I want to be by your side, unknowing of the truth
Passing through the night, dreaming―――.
And when we finally awaken
We'll add to the song that tells of the new end

Those who know of the "Truth" on the underside of a certain truth
Those who yell that the certain truth they were given is the "Truth"

Time spins, the world asks questions to lead you astray 
To fight against the inescapable fate, that is the future

The two of us will light the long night, wandering the dream of a short spring night
Not knowing anything, not hearing anything―――
I just want to connect to the future of the days we both exist
Whose truth is that?

At the least, I want to be by your side, unknowing of the truth
Passing through the night, dreaming
And when we finally awaken
We'll add to the song that tells of the new world
