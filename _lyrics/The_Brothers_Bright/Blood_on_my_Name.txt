====== Blood on my Name ======

There's a reckoning a'comin
And it burns beyond the grave
With lead inside my belly
Cause my soul has lost its way.
Oh, Lazarus, how did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus, were you so afraid?
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
With the hounds of hell comin' after you
I've got blood
I've got blood on my name.
When the fires, when the fires are consuming you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood
I've got blood, blood on my name.
Not a spell gonna be broken
With a potion or a priest.
When you're cursed you're always hopin'
That a prophet would be grieved.
Oh, Lazarus, how did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus, were you so afraid?
Can't you see I'm sorry?
I will make it worth your while.
I'm made of dead man's money
You can see it in my smile.
Oh, Lazarus, how did your debts get paid?
Oh, Lazarus, were you so afraid?
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
And the whole wide world's comin' after you.
I've got blood
I've got blood on my name.
When the fires, when the fires are consuming you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood
I've got blood, blood on my name.
It won't be long, 'til I'm dead and gone
It won't be long, 'til I'm dead and gone
Watch the fires rise, burn through the skin
Down to the bone, scorchin' my soul
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
With the hounds of hell comin' after you
I've got blood
I've got blood on my name.
When the fires, when the fires are consuming you
And your sacred stars won't be guiding you
I've got blood
I've got blood, blood on my name.
When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you
And the whole wide world's comin' after you.
I've got blood
I've got blood
Blood on my name.
