====== Wicked Game ======
Created Friday 10 September 2021

No one could save me
No one, no one could save me
No one could save me
No one, no one could save me
No one could save me
No one, no one could save me
No one could save me
No one, no one could save me
No one could save me
No one, no one could save me
No one could save me
No one, no one could save me...

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do

No I don't want to fall in love
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked thing to say you
what a wicked thing to say you
what a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

And I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love
With you

No I don't want to fall in love

The world was on fire and no one could save me
No one could save me
It's strange what desire
No one could save me
No one could save me
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you

The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire
The world was on fire...
